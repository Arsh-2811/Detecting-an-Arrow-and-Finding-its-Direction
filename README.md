# ARROW DETECTION AND DIRECTION USING OPEN CV

How amazing it would be if we can make a machine that has a camera and has the capability to take live videos of surrounding and navigate itself to a location just with the help of arrow signs on its path . Seems Futuristic ?? No , it is a real thing now . In this project , our computer will be detecting an arrow from a random background using its webcam and will be printing direction in which the arrowhead is pointing . This is done using python3.x and OpenCV.

## General info
This project detects an arrow in the video taken by the webcam and detects it direction and specifies angle made by the arrowhead with horizontal axis.

## Technologies
* openCV
* numpy

## Generation
* First Generation - Detect a red arrow from a random background and detect its direction
* Second generation - Detect any color arrow from a random background and detect its direction - (Still in progress)

## Status
Second generation is still in progress
